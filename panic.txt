Panic(uint256)
0x4e487b71

0x01: assert(false)
0x11: arithmetic overflow
0x12: divide by zero
0x13: enum out of range
0x31: array underflow
0x32: index out of bounds
0x41: overlarge array / out of memory
0x51: call to default internal function

Note: Even zero function yields Panic(0x51) now, because Solidity now checks for
zero!  And converts to default on load from storage.

errors:
*. require(false)
*. call contract w/no code
*. got ether but not payable
*. transfer() fails
[*. decoding errors, I would assume?]
