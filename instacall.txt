Things that cause instacalls:

guaranteed by the yellow paper:
*. attempting to pay more than you have (instarevert)
*. attempting to call when the EVM callstack is full (1024) (instarevert)
not guaranteed but don't see how else it could be handled:
*. calling a precompile
*. attempting to overwrite existing (instarevert) [EIP suggests it could get to
	first instruction and *then* revert, but that doesn't make a lot of
	sense]
not guaranteed, has an alternative, but seems to be the case:
*. calling an account with no code (regardless of why it has no code!)
*. creating an account while passing no code

ANOMALOUS SITUATION:
run off looks like a revert even though it's not!
I think we need better revert detection
(yes, we do)
