Things that cause instacalls:

*. attempting to pay more than you have (instarevert)
*. attempting to call when the EVM callstack is full (1024) (instarevert)
*. calling a precompile
*. attempting to overwrite existing (instarevert) [EIP suggests it could get to
	first instruction and *then* revert, but that doesn't make a lot of
	sense]
*. calling an account with no code (regardless of why it has no code!)
*. creating an account while passing no code
*. creating an account with nonce maxed out (instarevert)
	TODO: is this an instarevert, or does this cause the containing tx to
	revert? the spec is unclear

ANOMALOUS SITUATION:
run off looks like a revert even though it's not!
I think we need better revert detection
(yes, we do)
