Pure and view functions that don't take or return storage pointers go in the
ABI and do not have the delegatecall guard.
Other functions were removed from the ABI as of 0.5.6.
The delegatecall guard was added in 0.4.20.
The internalType field was added in 0.5.11.

Note that before 0.5.6, even functions that took or returned storage pointers
went in the ABI!
They just had their types written out... even structs!
bytes32[] storage
mapping(bytes => bytes) storage
HasPure.PointToMe storage
...BUT... you can't trust this because this *only* applies to storage!
memory or calldata structs are still given the normal way, which is wrong in the
library context
So, we can't rely on this :(
