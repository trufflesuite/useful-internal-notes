Ways to revert/exceptional halt, other than instareverts (instacall.txt):
*. REVERT
*. Invalid opcode (INVALID)
*. Stack underflow
*. Out of gas (including when paying the code deposit cost)
*. Jump (JUMP or taken JUMPI) to anywhere not a JUMPDEST, including past end
*. Stack overflow (1024)
*. Reading past the end of returndata with RETURNDATACOPY (doesn't apply to
	CALLDATACOPY or CODECOPY!)
*. Doing something nonstatic inside a STATICCALL (not just the call itself, but
	anything it calls).  Nonstatic things:
	*. doing an SSTORE
	*. doing a CREATE or CREATE2
	*. doing a SEFLDESTRUCT
	*. doing a LOG0, LOG1, LOG2, LOG3, LOG4
	*. doing a CALL or CALLCODE with nonzero value
*. a creation returns a contract beginning with 0xef (as of London)

Things *not* reverted by an exceptional halt or revert:

Gas used (duh)
The nonce increment (to the caller) *for the reverted stackframe itself*, if any
(nonce increments from *inside* the reverted stackframe *are* reverted, and if
the call was itself a creation call, the nonce of the created contract won't get
incremented)

(yellow paper says self-destructs and logs aren't reverted, but it's wrong)
