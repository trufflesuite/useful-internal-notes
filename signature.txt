library signatures:

Libraries use old-style signatures, meaning that structs are given as
ContractName.StructName
rather than as a tuple.
Enums are done similarly.
Contracts are also given by contract name rather than as "address".

However, function types and address payable are treated as normal.
ALSO, UDVTs are treated transparently!!  They are *not* done the library way!!

Also, if a type is storage, " storage" is appended to the end.
Note that this of course only happens at the very end.

Also, mappings are allowed, as
mapping(keyType => valueType)

(and yes, " storage" is then appended)

OK, TESTING TIME
