Compiled useful notes on the EVM, Solidity, Vyper, and etc.

These were originally my (Harry's) private notes, but I figured other people
may want to see them.  I cannot guarantee that I will consistently update these
so be aware that they may be out of date.

Also because these were my private notes, they may contain various stuff that's
really just not relevant to anyone but me, or may omit things that I don't care
about.  Sorry, I haven't bothered to clean them up at all.

They're not public because then I'd have to properly maintain them and make
them generally readable, and that's a lot more work than just throwing up
some notes on a private repo.  (See e.g.
[this document](https://ethdebug.github.io/solidity-data-representation/)
which took quite a bit of time to write up properly and I now do maintain;
this was originally a series of private notes, and had I left it that way,
it would have gone a lot quicker!)

I omitted any files that I didn't think would be of relevance to anyone but me.

If you want to add your own notes, uh, go ahead?  Maybe update the readme along
with it.
