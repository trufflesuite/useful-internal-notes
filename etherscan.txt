Solidity; Solidity(Multi); Solidity(JSON); Vyper

JSON presently does *not* allow Yul best I can tell!
(this is unlike Blockscout)
it *does* seem to allow SolidityAST :O
(I assume that's unintentional)

result -> 0 -> ...

if it doesn't exist, SourceCode will be "" and ABI will be
"Contract source code not verified"

SourceCode		//source; or multiple sources; or full compiler input!
ABI			//ignore
ContractName		//can use for path, I guess
CompilerVersion		//version
OptimizationUsed	//settings [not in JSON case]
Runs			//settings [not in JSON case]
ConstructorArguments	//ignore!
EVMVersion		//settings; may be "Default" [basic case only]
Library			//settings [not in JSON case]
LicenseType		//ignore
Proxy			//ignore
Implementation		//ignore
SwarmSource		//ignore

note: Libraries in Library are separated by semicolons, with library name
separated from the address by a colon

multiple sources:
has same format as sources object for compiler input

compiler input:
language: //ignore
sources: //sources! each has a name, each has a content field
settings: //settings!
outputSelection //ignore
