Blockscout's GraphQL api seems to be missing # of runs??

meanwhile it's non-GraphQL api seems to be *almost* the same as Etherscan's but
not quite; the runs field is called something different

however that's in the single-source case; no idea what it does in the JSON case,
the sourcify case, or the Vyper case

blockscout error case: (seems to sometimes happen for no reason?)
(a good reason not to turn this on by default :P )
{
  message: "Something went wrong.",
  result: null,
  status: "0"
}

blockscout not verified case:
{
  message: "OK",
  status: "1",
  result: [{
    ABI: "Contract source code not verified",
    ...
  }]
}

blockscout single source case:
{
  message: "OK",
  status: "1",
  result: [{
    ABI: string; //(JSON)
    CompilerVersion: string;
    ConstructorArguments?: string; //no leading 0x, excluded if empty
    ContractName: string;
    EVMVersion: string | null; //uses "default", lowercase, but can be null...?
    ExternalLibraries?: { //not stringly-typed, thank god!
      address_hash: string; //address
      name: string;
    }[]; //not included if there are none
    FileName: "";
    ImplementationAddress?: string; //only included if IsProxy is true
    IsProxy: string; //"true" or "false" (!)
    OptimizationRuns?: number | null; //I assume null means default? (excluded
	//altogether if optimization not used)
    OptimizationUsed: string; //"true" or "false" (!)
    SourceCode: string; //note: there's no header unlike w/Etherscan
    Address: string;
  }]
}

blockscout vyper case:
{
  message: "OK",
  status: "1",
  result: [{
    ABI: string; //(JSON)
    CompilerVersion: string; //does *not* explicitly indicate Vyper!!
	//just a short version string
    ConstructorArguments?: string;
    ContractName: "Vyper_contract"; //what you enter is ignored
    EVMVersion: null; //no option to set this
    FileName: "";
    ImplementationAddress?: string; //only included if IsProxy is true
    IsProxy: string; //"true" or "false" (!)
    OptimizationUsed: "false"; //again, no option to set this
    SourceCode: string;
    Address: string;
  }]
}

blockscout JSON case: I couldn't get this to work! TODO
(why do I suspect it's coerced into the format below, which is no good...?)

blockscout metadata-and-sources case: (UH-OH, NO GOOD)
[but in this case, it also gets verified on Sourcify, so...]
{
  message: "OK",
  status: "1",
  result: [{
    ABI: string; //(JSON)
    AdditionalSources?: { //sources beyond the main file! excluded if none
      Filename: string; //uses name compiler sees
      SourceCode: string;
    }[];
    CompilerVersion: string;
    ConstructorArguments?: string;
    ContractName: string;
    EVMVersion: string | null;
    ExternalLibraries?: {
      address_hash: string; //address
      name: string;
    }[];
    FileName: string; //for the main file! uses name compiler sees
    ImplementationAddress?: string;
    IsProxy: string;
    OptimizationRuns?: number | null;
    OptimizationUsed: string;
    SourceCode: string; //for the main file!
    Address: string;
  }]
}
UH-OH, METADATA IS MISSING
I did this with debug revert strings on and that's not reflected here!!
