how getters work, for complex types:
1. arrays do not return an array, but rather take a uint argument
2. mappings take an argument of the type of the key
3. structs generally do not return the struct, but rather destructure into
their particular components, but with arrays and mappings omitted
4. however, structs *inside other structs* return the particular struct -- this
*includes* any arrays, and any mappings are forbidden
