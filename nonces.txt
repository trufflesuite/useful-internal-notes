a nonce is incremented when:
*. a contract is *successfully* created at the account (on return)
	[but this can be reverted by a containing stackframe]
*. the account originates a tx (on call), *even if it reverts*
*. the account runs a CREATE or CREATE2 (on call), *even if it reverts*
	[but this can itself be reverted by a containing stackframe]

Note: Remember that storage address is what has nonce incremented, relevant for
DELEGATECALL or CALLCODE!
