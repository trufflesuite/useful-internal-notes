a nonce is incremented when:
*. the account originates a tx (on call), *even if it reverts*
*. the account runs a CREATE or CREATE2 (on call), *even if it reverts*
	[but this can itself be reverted by a containing stackframe]
*. a contract is created at a given address (on call, but reverted if fails)
	[as of Spurious Dragon! false before!]
	[and this can be reverted by a containing stackframe]

Note: Remember that storage address is what has nonce incremented, relevant for
DELEGATECALL or CALLCODE!
