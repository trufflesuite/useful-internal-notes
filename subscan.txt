overall format:
{
  code: 0,
  message: "Success",
  generated_at: number,
  data: {
    //see relevant fields below; there are also other irrelevant fields
  }
}

case when not verified: one of two things can happen.
1. data is null
2. data is
{
  abi: null,
  source_code: "",
  method_identifiers: null,
  event_identifiers: null,
  verify_status: "", <- go by this?
  contract_name: "",
  compiler_version: "",
  evm_version: "",
  external_libraries: null,
  optimize: false,
  optimization_runs: 0,
}
(plus irrelevant fields)

case on error:
{
  code: nonzero number,
  message: specific error message,
  generated_at: number
}
(e.g., code 400 for bad address, or code 20008 for rate limit exceeded or
present-but-bad API key)

relevant fields:

source_code //string
contract_name //string
compiler_version //string
evm_version //string; may be "default"
external_libraries //need to learn the format of this; may be null
optimize //boolean
optimization_runs //number; present even if optimize is false
verify_status //not clear what valid values are here; can be "partial" if
	//verified; what else is possible, "total"?

how does external_libraries work?
